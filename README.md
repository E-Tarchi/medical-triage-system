# Medical Triage System (Beta v0.1)

## Project Overview
This is a Python-based triage tool designed to automate clinical assessment logic. 
The project is built upon my professional experience as a **Social and Health Care Worker (OSS - Operatore Socio Sanitario)**, applying healthcare domain knowledge to software development.

This repository represents the first milestone in my journey toward becoming a **Cloud Engineer** while pursuing my **L-31 Computer Science for Business** degree.

## Key Features (v0.1 Beta)
- **Vital Signs Monitoring**: Input fields for Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) and Systolic Blood Pressure.
- **Clinical Priority Logic**: Automated triage categorization (Red, Yellow, Green).
- **Respiratory Alert**: System notification for Blood Gas Analysis (BGA/EGA) based on SpO2 levels.
- **Cardiac Screening**: Logic-based routing for patients reporting cardiac symptoms.

## Technical Foundations
- **Logic & Flow**: Implementation of nested conditional statements and user-driven loops.
- **Domain Integration**: Translating healthcare protocols into executable Python code.
- **Professional Standards**: Full English codebase and documentation for global accessibility.

## Future Roadmap
- Local file logging for patient records.
- Multi-user authentication for shift management.
- Transitioning to **AWS** (Amazon Web Services) architecture.
