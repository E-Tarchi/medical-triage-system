🏥 Medical Triage System (v0.2)
🚀 Project Overview
This is a Python-based triage tool designed to automate clinical assessment logic. The project is built upon my professional experience as a Healthcare Professional (OSS), applying healthcare domain knowledge to software development.

This repository represents a key milestone in my journey toward becoming a Cloud Engineer while pursuing my L-31 Computer Science degree.

✨ Key Features (v0.2 Update)
Full Triage Categorization: Implementation of the complete color-coded priority system (Red, Yellow, Green, White).

Vital Signs Monitoring: Real-time input for Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) and Systolic Blood Pressure.

Clinical Priority Logic: Automated decision-making based on physiological thresholds.

Respiratory Alert: Dedicated logic for Blood Gas Analysis (BGA/EGA) requirements based on SpO2 levels.

Cardiac Screening: Logic-based routing for patients with chest pain or arrhythmias.

🛠️ Technical Foundations
Logic & Flow: Optimized use of while loops and complex conditional statements (if/elif/else).

Domain Integration: Translating real-world healthcare protocols into executable Python code.

Professional Standards: Full English codebase and documentation for global accessibility and recruiter review.

🗺️ Future Roadmap
[ ] Data Persistence: Implementing local file logging or SQL integration for patient records.

[ ] Error Handling: Introducing try-except blocks to manage invalid user inputs.

[ ] Cloud Integration: Deploying the logic as an AWS Lambda function to start the transition to cloud architecture.
